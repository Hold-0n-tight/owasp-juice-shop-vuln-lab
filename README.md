# OWASP Juice Shop Vulnerability Lab (ASM Perspective)

This project is a hands-on web vulnerability research lab based on OWASP Juice Shop.
The goal is to understand OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities by directly identifying,
exploiting, and validating them from an Attack Surface Management (ASM) perspective.

## Objectives
- Understand what each OWASP Top 10 vulnerability actually means in practice
- Identify attack surfaces exposed by a web application
- Manually verify vulnerabilities and analyze response differences
- Create simple Proof of Concept (PoC) scripts for reproducibility
- Gain experience with both manual testing and automated scanning tools

## Environment
- Target: OWASP Juice Shop (Docker-based)
- Tools: Docker, OWASP ZAP, Firefox
- OS: macOS
